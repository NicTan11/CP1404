About the Repository

## About the Author
My name is Nickson, and I am a student at James Cook University Singapore. I am currently studying Bachelor Of Information Technology and working on improving my programming skills, especially in Python.

### Lessons Learned
During this subject, I have learned valuable lessons about clean code. Here are three main lessons:
- Naming Conventions: Use clear and descriptive variable, function, and class names to make the code easier to understand and maintain. 
- Code Organization: Separate code into functions and classes to make it modular and reusable, as well as easier to test and debug. 
- Comments and Documentation: Add comments to explain complex or unclear parts of the code, and use docstrings to provide information about the purpose and usage of functions and classes.
